# MVC Core 2 Web API Best Practices

This code supports the concepts I was talking about at the Greenville Spartanburg Developers' Guild May 15, 2018 meeting. The PowerPoint presentation is included in the docs folder.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a development environment with the ASP.NET Core 2 package installed.

### Installing

•	Get the source code from Github and add it to your workspace.
•	Find the appsettings.json file and set the name of your SQL Server in the connectionStrings setting.
•	Build and run the application. The initial build may take a while as the nuget packages are downloaded.
